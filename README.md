# LanguageTool Language Server

> NOTICE: It is in too early a stage, so it just the basic works, but not yet as I want it to. A lot of improvements on the architecture and on the code are required before it be usable on an everyday life. If you like the idea, contribute to the project; I'll appreciate a lot.

LanguageTool Language Server is a implementation of LSP protocol to enable proofreading/text analysis from great IDEs to any text editor (VSCode & NVim) that supports Microsoft's Language Server Protocol.

## Features

- [] check for errors in the file
    - [] check for errors in git files
    - [x] check for errors in strings (`""`, `''`, ` `` `)
    - [x] check for errors in comments (`//`, `/*`)
- [] use fix based on suggestions
- [] add and remove words from dictionary


## Usage

Building the project to test requires that you run the `build` script. It will convert the Typescripts files on `src/` to JavaScript on `build/` and runnable on NodeJS vanilla.

```sh
npm run build
```

If you are working on the Typescript files, you should want to build it automatically, so run the `dev` command, what will generate, on each change, the files on `build/` folder.

```sh
npm run dev
```

As it uses the LanguageTool as the service to perform the text analysis, so you should have a clone of its project inside the `bin/` folder. Check the NPM 's `server` command on `package.json` file to more information. This command will start a new server of LanguageTool to receive the requests send by LLS ( LanguageTool Language Server ).

```sh
npm run server
```

In order maintain a pattern on the code, there is a `fmt` command to format all Typescripts inside the `src/`.

```sh
npm run fmt
```

## Configuration

After the `build/` folder was generated by `build` or `dev` commands, you are able to use the LLS on your editor.

###  NVim (coc-nvim)

Using the basic of LLS on NVim with `coc-nvim`, just type `:CocConfig` and add the code's snippet below to it:

```json
{
	"languageserver": {
		"languagetool-language-server": {
			"module": "<path>/languagetool-language-server/build/index.js",
            "args": ["--node-ipc"],
            "filetypes": ["*"],
			"initializationOptions": {
			}
		}
	}
}
```
